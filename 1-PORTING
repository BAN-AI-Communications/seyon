    Seyon is reported to run on most Unix platforms. Before compiling
    Seyon, edit the file config.h according to your system. Normally,
    config.h is the only file that you need to edit in order to
    compile Seyon.

    If you compile and run Seyon successfully, provide me with
    information like the ones below. I'd appreciate that. (I can
    withhold your email address if you like).

    The code right now is not very clean and not well-documented, but
    I'm working on that. If you encounter a problem while porting,
    send a letter to me or the Seyon mailing list and I'll help as
    much as I can, especially with explanations on what the various
    parts, of the code do. See the FAQ on how how to joing the list.

    The following is a list of machines/OS combinations Seyon is
    reported to run on. If you want your name or address taken out of
    the list (e.g. in fear some luusers who have a system like yours
    might contact you if they have a problem :), send me mail to that
    effect, and I'll take it out of the next release.

DETAILED NOTES:

------------------------------
A) Using the sgtty interface and BSD ioctls (old BSD systems that have
   neither the POSIX termios nor the SYSV termio interfaces, like
   SunOS 3.x): 

From bob@snuffy.penfield.ny.us (Bob Smith):

Well here it is, finally...  This will allow seyon to compile and
function using BSD ioctls, although I should probably mention
'where it's at'...

1) setting 8-bit mode puts the modem port into RAW mode.  This
   disables Xon/Xoff and any parity settings that may be active,
   even though the Xon/Xoff and parity settings will still show
   as they are currently set.  Returning to 7-bit mode puts the
   port back into CBREAK where Xon/Xoff and parity are once
   again active.  There is no 5 or 6 bit mode, selecting those
   behave the same as 7 bit mode (re-establishes CBREAK)...

2) There is no ISTRIP equivalent in the BSD ioctls of my machine.
   So that function is simply ifdef'd out...

3) Stop bits will always be 1...  although my machine seems to have
   an extension to allow setting 1 or 2 stop bits, I don't know how
   portable that may be...  and since I've never had a need for 2
   stop bits, I chose to leave it out...

4) ...and something that's had me stumped for the last couple of days.
   The 'led' indicators in the seyon control panel don't work for me???
   For the life of me I can't figure out why, since I know from other
   experience that the modem control ioctls DO work...  At one time
   I had some debug code in, and sure enough, they start out working
   and then quit when the initial modem settings are plugged in...
   I'll figure it out eventually! :-)
