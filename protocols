# this a ready-to-use example of the protocols file
# just move it to ~/.seyon, or whatever your Seyon's
# default directory is

# note that this file has nothing to with Zmodem auto-download.
# you have to use the resources 
# zmodemAutoDownload and
# zmodemAutoDownloadCommand for that.
# see the manula page for more details.

# the format is simple.

# the first field is the title (the name that appears in
# the file transfer console).
# the presence of this field is reuired.

# the second field is the command (if it starts with $, stdin
# and stdout will be redirected to the modem port.
# the presence of this field is reuired.

# the third field is whether that protocol requires 
# a file name argument (like in uploading, for instance).
# the presence of this field is reuired.

# you can put comments on a single line
# or at the end of a line

regular_zmodem_dl    "$ cd /usr/dl; rz -vv" n # like in here

# blank lines are OK too, for readability.

# the title has to be either a single word, like the above
# or a collection of words, but quoted, like below.

# you put anything instead of y as long as it starts
# with y: y, Y, yes, yep ..etc.

"regular zmodem ul"  "$ cd /usr/src; sz -vv" y

# anything that doesn't start with a y is a no
# e.g. n, N, NO, Not, nope, nien, nono ..etc.
# even hello, but the use of words that doesn't start
# with n is highly discouraged

graphic_zmodem_dl    "cd /usr/dl; grz        No
xrz3D                "$cd /usr/dl; xrz"      NO

# here is my own protocols file
# notice how I make it clear to myself
# whether I'm uploading or downloading

"SEND - Zmodem" "$cd /usr/src; sz -vv" y
"RECEIVE - Reg. Zmodem" "$cd /usr/dl; rz -vv"  n
"RECEIVE - Xrz3D" "$cd /usr/dl; xrz" n
