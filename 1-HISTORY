    This files gives a history of revisions to xcomm 2.2, the
    text-based communication program Seyon was has its roots in. Seyon
    is vastly different from xcomm though and including the changes
    from xcomm to Seyon here would make no sense. This file is kept
    just for historical reasons. The file CHANGES describes the
    changes from the initial release of Seyon to the current one. It
    does not, however, describe the changes from xcomm to the initial
    release of Seyon. One thing to note is that although xcomm is
    public domain, Seyon is not (though it's free). Read the file
    COPYING for a full description of what the Seyon copyright
    entails.
