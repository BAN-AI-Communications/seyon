# this a ready-to-use example of the phone file
# just move it to ~/.seyon, or whatever your Seyon's
# default directory is

# line comment
# another one
# you can have comments both on a singe line
# and at end of lines

# blank lines are OK too, for readability.

# the format is simple.

# the first field is the phone number
# the presence of this field is reuired.

# the second field is the host name
# the presence of this field is reuired.

# all other fields are optional.
# if any of those is not present,
# Seyon will use the default value specified in the resources
# you don't even have to specifiy the default values in the resources
# if the default default values  (did you get this?) suit 
# you just fine, and most of the time they do.

# recognized fileds are
# SCRIPT        script file name to be run when connected
# BPS           baud rate
# BITS          number of bits
# PARITY        parity
# STOPB         number of stop bits
# PREFIX        prefix
# SUFFIX        suffix

# the keyword CURRENT (can be abbreviated to CUR) can be used
# to instruct Seyon to use the current values rather
# than giving the exact value or using the default ones
# in this case those fields will appear with a question mark (?)
# in the dialing directory since they depend on the current values
# (e.g. the number you called last or the values use set via the
# Settings window) and are not known ahead of time.
# frankly, I don't know why anybody would use this keyword.

# the title has to be either a single word, like the above
# or a collection of words, but quoted, like below.

# more examples:

258-7096 Athena BITS=7 SCRIPT=athena # using default BPS
258-7096 Athena BITS=7 BPS=19200 # no script

258-7096 Athena PREFIX=ATP # use pulse dialing, override default
258-7096 Athena PREFIX=AT%c1\n5DT # another example
258-7096 Athena PREFIX=AT%c1\n5^M~~ATDT # notice the 2-sec delay after ^M
258-7096 Athena PREFIX="AT %c1 \n5 ^M ~~ ATDT" # quoted because of spaces
258-7096 Athena SUFFIX=^M # overrides the default suffix

# here we use the the keyword CURRENT
