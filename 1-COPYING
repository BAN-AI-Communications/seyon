Seyon 2.20b and above are released under the GNU General Public
License by kind permission of the author and original maintainer of
seyon, Muhammad M. Saggaf. I contacted him by snail mail to ask him to
open up the code and here is his response:

======================================================================

I received your letter today (yes, I know it took a long time, it took a
trip half-way around the world and then back to my current address in the
U.S.). I share your view about license for Seyon, I think it is too
restrictive, especially that I'm not actively maintaining it. The purpose
behind that restriction was to prevent incompatible versions, really, but I
don't think it was the correct way of doing that. You have my permission to
modify the license (e.g. the GPL is just fine) and distribute the package
with the new license.

My very best wishes,

-- M. Saggaf
