Introduction:
=============

    Seyon is a complete full-featured telecommunications package for
    the X Window System.  Some of its features are:

    Dialing directory that supports an unlimited number of entries.
    The directory is fully mouse-driven and features call progress
    monitoring, dial timeout, automatic redial, multi-number dialing,
    and circular redial queue. Each item in the dialing directory can
    be configured with its own baud rate, bit mask, and script file.
    The dialing directory uses a plain-text phone book that can be
    edited from withen Seyon. Seyon also supports manual dialing.

    Terminal emulation window supporting DEC VT02, Tektronix 4014, and
    ANSI. Seyon delegates its terminal emulation to xterm, so all the
    familiar xterm functions such as the scroll-back buffer,
    cut-and-paste utility, and visual bell are availabe through
    Seyon's terminal emulation window. Using xterm also means that
    Seyon has a more complete emulation of VT102 than other any Unix
    or DOS telecommunications program. Other terminal emulation
    programs can also be used with Seyon to suit the user's need; for
    example, color xterm can be used to provide emulation for color
    ANSI (popular on many BBS systems), and xvt can be used if memory
    is a bit tight.

    Script language to automate tedious tasks such as logging into
    remote hosts. Seyon's script interpreter uses plain-text files and
    has a syntax similar to that of sh, with a few extra addtions. It
    supports many familiar statements such as conditional branching by
    if-else and looping by goto. Scripts may be assigned to items in
    the dialing directory for automatic execution after a connection
    is made.

    Unlimited number of slots for external file transfer protocols.
    Protocols are activated from a mouse-driven transfer console that
    uses a plain-text file, editable from withen Seyon, for protocol
    configuration. Seyon prompts the user for filenames only if the
    chosen protocol requires filenames or if the transfer operation is
    an upload, for which Seyon also accepts wildcards. Multiple
    download directories can be specified for the different transfer
    slots.

    Support for zmodem auto-download. Seyon detects incoming zmodem
    signature and automatically activates a user-specified zmodem
    protocol to receive incoming files. Zmodem transfers can thus be
    completely automatic and require no user intervention.

    Translation modes. Seyon can perfrom useful trasnlations on the
    user's input. From example, Seyon can translate backspace to
    delete (useful on may Unix systems), newline to carriage return
    (useful on many BBS hosts), and my favorite, meta key tranlation:
    to send keys pressed while the meta (ALT) key is held down as an
    escape (ESC) followed by the key press. The latter mode simulates
    the meta key on hosts that do not support 8-bit-clean connections
    and makes possible the use of the meta key in programs like Emacs
    on such hosts.

    Other features: interactive setting of program parameters, on-line
    help, software (XONN/XOFF) and hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control,
    session capture to a file, and temporary running of a local shell
    in the terminal emulation window.

    Seyon is intended to be both simple and extensively configurable.
    Almost every aspect of Seyon can be configured via the resources
    to suit the user's taste.

Portability:
============

    Seyon is reported to run on most Unix platforms. Read the file
    PORTING for more details.

Use:
====

    Please read the manual page and the FAQ to learn how to use Seyon.
    I've put a lot of effort into making the manual page as accurate
    and up-to-date as possible.

IMPORTANT:

    Add the resource 'Seyon.modem: /dev/ttys0' to your Xdefaults file
    (substitute your modem device for /dev/ttys0) or invoke seyon by
    the switch '-modem /dev/ttys0'. You have to specify the full path
    name of the device in all cases.

    The name of the startup file is 'seyon'. That of the dialing
    directory is 'phonelist' and that of the protocols file is
    'protocols'. These have to be in directory called '~/.seyon' by
    default or in the current or home directoy. Examples are provided.

    To use Seyon, just invoke from anywhere by 'seyon &'. That's about
    it.

    To advantage of Seyons's color, add the following to your
    Xdefaults file:

              #ifdef COLOR
              *customization: -color
              #endif

Seyon is Free:
==============

    If you use Seyon and like it, sending me a picture postcard of a
    site in your area would be nice, and would give me the incentive
    to continue maintaining Seyon. If you don't feel like doing that
    (you lazy bum! :-), just let me know by e-mail.

Development:
============

    Seyon was written and is being maintained on a no-name 386SX-25
    PC-clone running linux with XFree86. The machine has 10MB of
    memory and a 200MB hard drive. Seyon has its roots in xcomm 2.2,
    which was written by Eric Coe and Larry Gensch.
